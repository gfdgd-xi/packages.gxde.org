Description: Guest-side qemu-system agent
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports Alpha, ARM,
 CRIS, i386, LoongArch, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, RISC-V,
 S390x, SH4, SPARC, x86-64, Xtensa and other emulations. By using dynamic
 translation it achieves reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host
 CPUs.
 .
 This package provides a daemon (agent) to run inside qemu-system
 guests (full system emulation).  It communicates with the host using
 a virtio-serial channel org.qemu.guest_agent.0, and allows one to perform
 some functions in the guest from the host, including:
  - querying and setting guest system time
  - performing guest filesystem sync operation
  - initiating guest shutdown or suspend to ram
  - accessing guest files
  - freezing/thawing guest filesystem operations
  - others.
 .
 Install this package on a system which is running as guest inside
 qemu virtual machine.  It is not used on the host.
